Rather than using git submodules, we've copied the contents of these
puppet modules into the FlexInterface repository directly.

We should consider creating forks of these repos inside the CSNW
organization, so that we can tag them as we desire, and commit patches
to them directly.  That would also make it easier to use git
submodules since we would have control over the various branches/tags
that we would be pinning to when adding them as submodules to the
Flexinterface repo.
