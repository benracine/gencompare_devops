**Steps towards creating a valid VM**

- You will need to have Ruby and gems installed which are not addressed here

		$ gem install vagrant

- Grab the code and move into the working directory:

		$ git clone git@github.com:benracine/gencompare_devops.git
		$ cd gencompare_devops

- Per the [vagrant homepage](http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html)
+ Grab a base box template from the web:

		$ vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box
		$ vagrant up 
		$ vagrant ssh
		vagrant@lucid32:~$ sudo dpkg --configure -a 
		vagrant@lucid32:~$ exit


## I copied the cheat sheet below so that I can use it as a grab-bag ##

## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###             (Hashes on right are optional)

## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##         {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](http://warpedvisions.org), and a literal . 
Now some SimpleLinks, like one to [google] (automagically links to are-you-
feeling-lucky), a [wiki: test] link to a Wikipedia page, and a link to 
[foldoc: CPU]s at foldoc.  

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}

~~~

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

### Horizontal rules

--------------------------


<div class="custom-class" markdown="1">
This is a div wrapping some Markdown plus.  Without the DIV attribute, it ignores the 
block. 
</div>

## Markdown plus tables ##

| Header | Header | Right  |
| ------ | ------ | -----: |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)

## Markdown plus definition lists ##

Bottled water
: $ 1.25
: $ 1.55 (Large)

Milk
Pop
: $ 1.75

* Multiple definitions and terms are possible
* Definitions can include multiple paragraphs too

*[ABBR]: Markdown plus abbreviations (produces an <abbr> tag)
